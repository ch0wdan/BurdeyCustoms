# QSSCustom


Do you own your own vehicle?
Do you own a SUV or hatchback?
Are you an outdoor enthusiast who loves traveling?

What we do:
We are a custom interior vehicle designer and builder. We will discuss with you what your needs are, what you plan to do, and where you plan to go, then we come up with a few design ideas and give you some options on how we can proceed. Once you agree to a design concept, we will take your vehicle to our shop and start the interior remodel. Once the remodel is complete, we will deliver the vehicle to you.

How long does a typical remodel take?
It depends on a number of factors, but we typically estimate between 1 week and 8 weeks.

How much does it cost?
It depends on a number of factors. We often like to charge a flat rate for the project and pass the material cost onto you. This way you can have a budget build yet a high quality finish at a fraction of the cost.

Why choose us over a mainstream brand?
We are a small company, our focus is not to generate a massive amount of revenue, rather get people out there and exploring. We had an amazing trip in our personal vehicle, and we want others to be able to do that as well. That being said, we try to keep costs as low as possible, yet have a finish better suited to the person(s) who the vehicle is for. Everyone is different. Everyone has different needs and you can't mass produce something to fit everyones needs.

About Us:
QSS Customs was started when my fiancee and I decided that it was time for us to explore the world. We quit our jobs, sold everything we owned and moved into two backpacks and traveled Europe for 6 months. After returning from Europe to the USA, we moved into a 1996 Toyota 4Runner 4x4 named "Hubert Farnsworth" with the goal of traveling to remote locations in the USA and Mexico.

Hubert has been field tested with over 30,000 miles under his belt in the 2017/2018 travel year with lots of improvements and lessons learned along those 30k miles.
